# 🧾 Manager.io — POS (Point of Sale) Extension

> A free, self-contained Point-of-Sale terminal for [Manager.io](https://www.manager.io) — barcode scanning, cart, day register, receipts, and WhatsApp sharing, all in a single HTML file with no backend.

- **Payment method selection** — pulls all Cash & Bank accounts, sorts cash accounts first, and defaults to a cash account
- **Auto-generated invoice reference** — timestamp-based reference number (`POS-YYMMDD-HHMMSS`) applied per sale
- **Day Register** — open/close a daily cash drawer session (opening float, closing count, variance) with a printable Day Closing Report
- **Receipts** — on-screen receipt preview, thermal-style print layout, PDF download, and WhatsApp sharing
- **Setup panel** — configure the default customer and required custom fields directly from the extension
- **Light / dark theme toggle**
- **Responsive layout** — usable on tablets and narrower screens (POS-friendly breakpoints)

## 🧭 How to Use

Once installed inside Manager.io:

1. Click **⬇ Load All Records** — the extension fetches all inventory items, customers, and bank/cash accounts across all pages
2. Use the **⚙ Setup** panel to set a default customer and confirm required custom fields (do this once)
3. Scan a barcode, or type an item code/name in the search box and press **Enter** to add it to the cart
   - If a scanned code isn't recognized, you'll be prompted to quick-create a new inventory item with that code
4. Adjust quantity/price per line as needed, pick or confirm the **customer**, and choose a **payment method**
5. Click **🗄 Register** at the start of the day to open the cash register with an opening float; close it at day's end to reconcile and print the Day Closing Report
6. Complete the sale — a reference number is generated automatically
7. From the receipt screen, **print**, **download as PDF**, or **record the payment** back to Manager.io (the extension can perform write operations for creating receipts/invoices when used inside Manager)
8. Toggle 🌙/☀️ to switch between dark and light themes at any time

## ⚙️ Technical Details

| Property | Detail |
|---|---|
| File type | Single self-contained `index.html` file |
| External libraries | None (no CDN dependencies) |
| APIs used | `/api4/inventory-item-batch`, `/api4/customer-batch`, `/api4/bank-or-cash-account-batch`, `/api4/sales-invoice-batch`, plus starting balances, purchase invoices, debit/credit notes, and write-offs (for accurate stock computation) |
| Pagination | Full — loops all pages via `next_page_token` |
| Framework | Vanilla HTML / CSS / JavaScript — no build step required |
| Manager.io communication | `postMessage` API (standard extension protocol), with a direct-fetch fallback when running standalone for some helper operations |

## ⚠️ Current Limitations / Status

This extension is under active development and currently runs in **Standalone (cash sales) mode** by default. Known gaps being worked on:

- Inactive Cash & Bank accounts currently still appear in the payment method list
- Tax rates (e.g. VAT, WHT) are not yet applied to POS sales
- Displayed available stock quantity may not always match Manager's own item balance for complex scenarios
- No dedicated barcode field/setup guidance yet for physical barcode scanners
- Non-inventory items and inventory kits are not yet sellable through the POS
- No configurable default drawer account per payment method (currently defaults to the first cash account found)
- No dedicated mobile view (desktop/tablet layout only for now)

---

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This extension is an independent, community-built tool and is **not officially affiliated with or endorsed by Manager.io**. It is provided free of charge, as-is. Always verify sales and financial figures against your official Manager.io reports before making business decisions.

When installed inside Manager.io the POS can create Sales Invoices / Receipts (writes) via the postMessage bridge; exercise care when testing and use a safe business instance for development.
